# Unit Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
*Due February 16, 2015.  Brief presentations in class.*

### After the project, you will be able to:

*   Store data in a DataFrame, and export it in some shape or form (text file, database, json text files)
*   Visualize data through means of a python visualization tool (matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot)
*   Provide insight about the data in front of your peers

### Contents of your submission include

* Exploratory Data Analysis of your data set including visuals, subsets, acquistion notes, etc.
* Preliminary questions for your project
* Well organized ipython notebook with code and output.
* 5 minute presentation: A descriptive and visual tour of your dataset

### Going the Extra Mile

*   You can (and should!) rework your project into a post on your own blog. It's encouraged to share your work within your social networks.
*   Engineers should consider exploring frameworks for deploying visuals on the web: d3.js, shiny (you'd also have to learn R, which is encouraged), iPython Notebook

### Lesson material in order to complete Project

*   Fundamental Statistics Review
*   Python Basics and Using Libraries/Modules
*   Data collection, storage, and manipulation
*   Data visualization in Python

### Rubric

TBD

### Next Steps

*   Consider how the data collected could be used in predictive analytics application
