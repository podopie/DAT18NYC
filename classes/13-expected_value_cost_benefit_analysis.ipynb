    "### How do we use business goals as evaluation metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've discussed one crosswise metric that helps us evaluate false positive rate vs true positive rate (AUC). However, to Everyday Business Guy, AUC means nothing: he is more familiar with accuracy and would rather just have some model that best predicts accuracy. To improve the understanding of the model and connect it to Everyday Business Guy, we want to associate the confusion matrix with an expected value, using a cost benefit analysis matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is expected value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected value associates probabilities for the confusion matrix with values. Expected value says \"this is the expected outcome of the model, should we choose to use it for the business.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathmatically, expected value's equation looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$EV = \\sum p(o_x) * v(o_x)$\n",

    "\n",
    "### How do we find these values?\n",
