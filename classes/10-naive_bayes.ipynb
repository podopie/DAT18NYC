      "   * **Why Naive? It assumes all inputs (categories, predictors) are independent**: In the case of text: its blind to word context and meaning: \n",
      "   * **Naivete helps because negligible information is required** -- simply word counting and that's it -- faster testing and very simple construction on ANY text.  Naivete doesn't hurt because correctness is based on classification, not prediction.\n",
      "   * **Good Predictor, (possibly) Bad Estimator:** NB chooses among possible categories to find the one that is the greatest.  The associated probability assigned is not necessarily accurate.  For example -- it might predict an email is Spam at 80%, but the true value might be 95% -- this doesn't matter, since its just choosing the category, anything over 50% will give it a perfect score. So while good estimation means good prediction,  good prediction doesn't necessarily mean good estimation.\n",

      "### A great explanation of Bayes Classification\n",
      "*from [Mathias Brandewinder](http://clear-lines.com/blog/post/Naive-Bayes-Classification.aspx)*\n",
      "\n",
      "The canonical application of Bayes na\u00efve classification is in text classification, where the goal is to identify to which pre-determined category a piece of text belongs to  \u2013 for instance, is this email I just received spam, or ham (\u201cvaluable\u201d email)?\n",
      "\n",
      "The underlying idea is to use individual words present in the text as indications for what category it is most likely to belong to, using Bayes Theorem, named after the cheerful-looking Reverend Bayes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine that you received an email containing the words \u201cNigeria\u201d, \u201cPrince\u201d, \u201cDiamonds\u201d and \u201cMoney\u201d. It is very likely that if you look into your spam folder, you\u2019ll find quite a few emails containing these words, whereas, unless you are in the business of importing diamonds from Nigeria and have some aristocratic family, your \u201cnormal\u201d emails would rarely contain these words. They have a much higher frequency within the category \u201cSpam\u201d than within the Ham, which makes them a potential flag for undesired business ventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, let\u2019s assume that you are a lucky person, and that typically, what you receive is Ham, with the occasional Spam bit. If you took a random email in your inbox, it is then much more likely that it belongs to the Ham category.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bayes\u2019 Theorem combines these two pieces of information together, to determine the probability that a particular email belongs to the \u201cSpam\u201d category, if it contains the word \u201cNigeria\u201d:\n",
      "\n",
      "P(is \u201cSpam\u201d|contains \u201dNigeria\u201d) = P(contains \u201cNigeria|is \u201dSpam\u201d) x P(is \u201cSpam\u201d) / P(contains \u201cNigeria\u201d)\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, 2 factors should be taken into account when deciding whether an email containing \u201cNigeria\u201d is spam: how over-represented is that word in Spam, and how likely is it that any email is spammy in the first place?\n",
      "\n",
      "The algorithm is named \u201cNa\u00efve\u201d, because it makes a simplifying assumption about the text, which turns out to be very convenient for computations purposes, namely that each word appears with a frequency which doesn\u2019t depend on other words. This is an unlikely assumption (the word \u201cDiamond\u201d is much more likely to be present in an email containing \u201cNigeria\u201d than in your typical family-members discussion email).\n",
      "\n",
      "We\u2019ll leave it at that on the concepts \u2013  I\u2019ll refer the reader who want to dig deeper to the book, or to this explanation of text classification with Na\u00efve Bayes.\n"
