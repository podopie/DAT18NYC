      "### How Sklearn works\n",
      "\n",
      "Scikit Learn (sklearn), a machine learning library for python, will do much of our heavy lifting. While sklearn has everything we've used in statsmodels, there are two distinct differences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. sklearn is _modular_. We call sklearn modular because many of the classes (objects) we use can be easily switched out and replaced with other sklearn classes.\n",
      "2. sklearn's implementation feels more \"engineery.\" Instead of printing pretty tables, sklearn objects and their attributes return basic python and numpy data structures (floats/integers, lists, ndarrays, dictionaries)\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, while statsmodels is very functional as an exploratory tool (and for time series analysis!), sklearn can control our entire data mining workflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "### What is the Data Mining pipeline?\n",
      "\n",
      "So far in the coursework we've uncovered the heavylifting and processing of data, be it pulling datasets together, cleaning it up, aggregating and visualising. While we can use tools like regressions to fill in our exploratory view, our objectives are also often to predict and define. In order to do so, we need to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Understand the impact of our **model**. We define our model (for now) as the list of features ($X$) given a value to be predicted ($y$). In particular, we want a model that:\n",
      "    * Is logical (we should not see, for example, an inverse relationship if the value in someone's home and their income).\n",
      "    * Is statistically significant (low probabilities of significance due to randomness or chance)\n",
      "    * Has strong qualifiers or predictors in the outcome (if everything is significant, but the objective values for each feature are small, then our model does not best explain the predicted value).\n",
      "2. Evaluate the performance of our model by testing the predicted results\n",
      "3. Determine if there are additional needs to build a stronger model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, we need a solution to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Help us understand and automate the feature selection process. We can use the [feature selection](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#feature-selection) part of sklearn to do this.\n",
      "2. Split our data into a training set to \"learn\" from, and a test set to \"evaluate.\" We can use the [cross validation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.cross_validation) module of sklearn for this part.\n",
      "3. Use an algorithm to learn and evaluate. For today, we'll stick with [generalized linear models](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#linear-model).\n",
      "4. Optimize to some performance metric. With linear models, we've been using r-squared ($R^2$)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each class we use sklearn, we'll explore something new with feature selection or extraction, a cross validation technique, an algorithm, and review performance metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Practice: read through code and documentation\n",
      "\n",
      "On your own, read and comment on the following code, line by line, running it as necessary. Use the sklearn documentation or the built in help functions in ipython notebook to determine what's occurring. We'll review as a group."
