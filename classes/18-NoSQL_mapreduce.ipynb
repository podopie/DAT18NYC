    "NoSQL are databases that do not use the traditional table and field based system we are familiar with in SQL databases. Some of the more common NoSQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key/Value: simple variable datastore primary used in databases like Redis and Memcached. They are primary used for caching and fast retrieval of small data.\n",
    "BSON: a binary JSON derivitive. Primary used in Mongo and CouchDB. rows become \"documents\" and tables become \"collections\" (in the mongodb syntax)\n",

    "Mapreduce is a concept of splitting work across a system of small computers, but ultimately, explains processing in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Map: Produce key|value pairs depending on the task\n",
    "2. Shuffle|Sort: Sorts the key|value pairs\n",
    "3. Reduce: Combines pairs into a single output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally this follows the pattern across a distributed network of computers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mappers: computers tasked to take in data and run a map task\n",
    "2. Sorters: computers tasked to take the data from the mappers and sort\n",
    "3. Reducers: computers tasked to take in the sorted data and reduce the information\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='img/mapreduce.jpg'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The three tasks are technically synchronous. This means that the computers will not start reducing until all mappers have completed their jobs. Therefore it's important for the processor or system in place does its best to split the data processing evenly: if you have one mapper doing all the work, there is no advantage!\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks also also (typically) solved linearly. That is, we want to limit the number of passes through the data. So , consider how we could solve each of these reducer tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "`count`: We've solved this already! Take the previous count and add to it. mapreduce will want to presort keys so it is not searching for keys on the fly. What is something that could be solved similar to count?\n",
    "\n",
    "`max or min`: How would we solve these?\n",
    "\n",
    "Where would machine learning make sense in map reduce? Where would it not?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sidenote: What is MapReduce?\n",
    "MapReduce is Google's internal platform, though it has since been generalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How can we reproduce this behavior on our own computers?\n",
    "There's two relatively straight forward ways we could consider emulating mapreduce:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run python scripts in shell with the shell sort command to get a sense of how data is funnelled:\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    cat data.txt | mapper.py | sort | reducer.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. Run a python script with multiprocessing pools to see how processing can be expedited with multiple core computers.\n"
