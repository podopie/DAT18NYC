    "### What is a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases are traditionally organized in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A database has tables which represent individual entities or objects.\n",
    "* Tables have predefined schema – rules that tell it what the data will look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each table should have a primary key column:  a unique identifier for that row. Additionally, each table _can_ have a foreign key column: an id that links this to another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='' />\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **normalized** schema, tables are designed to be thin in order to minimize:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The amount of repeated information\n",
    "2. The amount of bytes stored\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='prd' />\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we had designed the database to look this way with one table?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='denormalized_view' />\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Repeated information is increased; the user information is repeated in each row.\n",
    "2. There is increased text storage (text bytes are larger than integer bytes)\n",
    "3. There is no need to join!\n",
    "\n",
    "The tradeoff between normalized and denormalized data is **speed vs storage**. Storage (for the most part) is the same everywhere.. so let's focus on the speed side. Speed breaks down into _read speed_ and _write speed_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the two data views:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which would we believe to be slower to read but faster to write?\n",

    "### SQL syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (structured query language) is a query language for loading, retrieving, and updating data in relational databases. Most commonly used SQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Oracle and MySQL\n",
    "2. SQL Server\n",
    "3. PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL-like structure is also heavily borrowed in large scale data languages and platforms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Apache Hive\n",
    "2. Apache Drill (based on Google's Dremel)\n",
    "3. Spark SQL\n",

    "\n",
    "While companies and data teams end up developing their own sense of SQL style, those new to SQL should adopt at least the following style:\n",

    "1. Keywords are upper case and begin new lines\n",
    "2. fields in their own lines\n",
    "3. continuations are indented\n",
    "\n",
